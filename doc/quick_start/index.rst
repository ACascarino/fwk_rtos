The XCore SDK is comprised of the following components:

- C Libraries - Libraries to support programming for XCore in the C programming language.
- Code Examples - Examples showing a variety of XCore features based on bare-metal and FreeRTOS programming.
- FreeRTOS - Libraries to support FreeRTOS operation on xcore.ai.
- Documentation - Getting started guides, references and API guides.

The SDK is designed to be used in conjunction with the xcore-ai Explorer board. The example applications compile targeting this board. Further information about the Explorer board, and xcore.ai device are available to authorized parties on `www.xmos.ai <https://www.xmos.ai/>`_. Future releases will include other xcore.ai hardware platforms, targeting specific use case applications. The following sections detail required tools, describe the example applications, upcoming features and how to get support and provide feedback.
