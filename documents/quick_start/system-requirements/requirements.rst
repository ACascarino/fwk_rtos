Prerequisites
*************

`Python 3.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ + is required, however, we recommend you setup an `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/>`_ environment before installing.  If necessary, download and follow Anaconda's installation instructions.

`xTIMEComposer 15.0.6 + <https://www.xmos.com/software/tools/>`_ and `CMake 3.14 <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ + are required for building the example applications.  If necessary, download and follow the installation instructions for those components.

A standard C/C++ compiler is required to build applications and libraries on the host PC (tested with gcc 8.3.1+ and clang 11.0.0+).  macOS users may use the Xcode command line tools.
